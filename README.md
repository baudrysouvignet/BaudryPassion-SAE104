# BaudryPassion | SAE104 | V1

This repository contains the project "BaudryPassion" developed for the SAE104 (Situation d'Apprentissage et d'Ã‰valuation) course. The project focuses on creating a static website comprising two pages, with no responsive design, while adhering to best practices. The chosen theme for this project is my passion, which is technology. Only one CSS file is allowed.

## Project Details

The "BaudryPassion-SAE104" was developed during the web resource period. Originally, this website was intended to serve as a proof of concept (POC) and evolve further with the integration of a database and other features. However, due to restrictions on using PHP, the project was concluded quickly. Nevertheless, with ample time available and the potential for improvement, I decided to create a second website during the designated project period, which can be found in the "F1-SAE104" repository.
